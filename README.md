## How to run the App

You need to have Node.js already installed to run this app

In the Project Directory:

```cd client```

Run:

```yarn install```

Then:

```cd..```
```cd src```
```npm install```

To Install Server

N/B: You need to run the Client and The Server separately.
I had a slight problem configuring ``concurrently`` npm package

To run tests:

```cd src```
